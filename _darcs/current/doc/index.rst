=============

Unfortunately, most documentation for the moment is `for
developers`_. There are also instructions regarding `suitable Java software`_
that is used to run Fenfire or compile it from source code.

However, we are happy to discuss the project, its `vision`_ 
and current software with prospective users and developers.
You can reach us by sending mail to `fenfire-dev@nongnu.org`__ 
(mailing list `fenfire-dev`_). Our IRC discussion takes place 
in *channel #fenfire on the Freenode servers* (e.g. irc.freenode.net)
and `discussion logs`__ are available.

The `project milestones`_ document gives a summary of
where we are at the moment.
