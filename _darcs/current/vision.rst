Vision of Fenfire
=================

*Everything has to do with everything else.*

All information you store in your computer has something
to do with other things you also store there. The complaint
letter you write to your online bookstore is a response
to the overly high bill they've send you. The photo your
best friend emailed you was taken on your shared holidays
in Italy, and the poem you've written yesterday was
also conceived there. The Aunt Mary whose birthday you
enter into your calendar is same as the Aunt Mary in
your address book, the same person that borrowed your
book about old English sheepdogs (which you have to 
remember to ask back from her).

Fenfire is a desktop environment which allows you to
express these relationships.

Fenfire, currently in the early stages of development, is based 
on `RDF`_. In Fenfire, all applications store data in connected 
RDF graphs. In RDF, "`anyone [is] (technically) allowed to say 
anything about anything`__;" for Fenfire, this means that
any application in the system can add information to any
'object' created by itself or by any other application.

We are developing techologies to view such connections
(`example`__).

Fenfire is a Free Software project.
