2008-05-21: Fenfire 0.2 release and LDOW2008
--------------------------------------------

:Posted by: `Tuukka`_

I'm releasing Fenfire 0.2 in the wake of `Linked Data on the Web`__
workshop of the `WWW2008`_ conference last month. 
Uldis__ was there presenting the submission 
`Browsing Linked Data with Fenfire`_.

Source code download: http://fenfire.org/downloads/fenfire-0.2.tar.gz

Instructions: README__

While updating the documentation to match the new version, I had a look at
version 0.1 and was reminded how primitive it was: no undo, custom properties,
custom URIs, or Linked Data loading. In addition to those, we now have color
theming and experimental support for rendering text starting with "TeX:" 
using LaTeX.

2007-02-13: Fenfire 0.1 released
--------------------------------

:Posted by: `Benja`_

Well, it's... been a while. Not much happened in the 1.5 years
before December 2006.

In December `Tuukka`_ and I started a new implementation
of Fenfire in the Haskell programming language, though, and we've
made some progress. Today we're releasing the first version of it.
We've started to use it as a notetaking tool, which is about all
that it is useful for at the moment. More to come.

The tarball is at http://fenfire.org/downloads/fenfire-0.1.tar.gz\ .

You can also look at the README__ in the darcs repository or at
some__ quick screenshots__.

This is a source code release which you'll have to compile yourself.
(If you're not a computer geek, stay away for now :-)) We've built it
on Debian and Ubuntu.

Any feedback would be welcome -- send mail to fenfire-dev@nongnu.org
or join us in #fenfire on the Freenode IRC network.

I've put two articles about Fenfire online: an `article about
Fentwine`_, an editor for structured information (in the RDF
format) we're developing, and an `article about the overall
Fenfire project`_. The first article has been published in the
proceedings of the `FOAF Galway workshop`_ (the "1st Workshop 
on Friend of a Friend, Social Networking and the Semantic Web");
the second article is an unpublished manuscript.

I managed to get my Savannah account to work again, 
so I can update this page! :-)

Tuomas Lukka, the founder of the project, has left the group
for personal reasons. The core team currently
consists of Matti Katila and me.

We have a new proposed logo, which you can see on the left
side of this page. An `SVG version`_ and a `PNG version`_
of the logo are available.

`An article about Storm`_, one of our subprojects,
is available from the `Hypertext'03 conference website`_.
I now have `my homepage`_ online, served through Storm.

`Danny Ayers`_ has `blogged about Fenfire`_ (with a
`follow-up`_), and I've written a bit about the current
status of the project in the comments.

The first versions of FenPDF and FenMM (formerly *FenMind*) are now
operational and we are enthusiastically started using them in our
work. Therefore, we have published a couple of `new screenshots`_
for Your pleasure.

.. _`new screenshots`: shots.html

You may also except new animations recorded and published in the
near future.

Summer is nearing its end, and we are almost back to full speed. 
Tuomas will be demoing FenPDF and ''FenMind'' at Internet Expo in 
Helsinki on 2003-08-27. 

Our material from a seminar in the spring is available online: 
`Fenfire goes NÃ¶rttiseminaari '03`__

At the same time, we're trying to get rid of more Gzz legacy, and have changed
to new `mailing lists`_.

`Paperbot`_ is online for browsing. It demonstrates the unique procedural 
textures that our LibPaper can generate. 

.. _Paperbot: http://himalia.it.jyu.fi/paperbot 

2003-04-29
----------

Started using LibPaper's (still part of LibVob) unique procedural
textures as background papers on Fenfire.org. Every page under
Fenfire.org will now on have its own unique background paper, though
textures might still change since they are not yet finally fixed in 
LibPaper.

Enjoy.
