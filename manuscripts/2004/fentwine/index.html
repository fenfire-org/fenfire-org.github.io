<h1><a name="abstract">Abstract</a></h1>
<p>We present an approach to RDF visualization
in which a <em>central</em> node is shown in the middle of the screen and
the nodes directly connected to it are arranged around it,
making a different node the central one when the user clicks
on it. With this <em>navigational</em> approach, the user can see which nodes are
connected to the central node without following long connective lines
through a graph. However, experience with our 
work-in-progress implementation suggests that more work is needed 
on representing common structures in a concise manner.</p>

<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h1><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>The usual approach to visualizing RDF graphs
is to create a 2D layout of all nodes in a graph.
This approach is taken by the <a class="reference" href="http://www.w3.org/2001/11/IsaViz/">IsaViz</a> and <a class="reference" href="http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/discovery/rdf-dev/rudolf/rdfviz/">RdfViz</a> applications, 
for example.
However, this approach, it can be hard to see which nodes are connected 
(Figures 1 and 2).</p>

<p>We propose to apply to RDF an approach
originally developed for semantic network visualization by the SemNet
research group (<a class="reference" href="#fisher-and-kibby-1996">Fisher and Kibby 1996</a>).
The <a class="reference" href="http://www.semanticresearch.com/">Semantica</a> software is based on this (<a class="reference" href="#figure-3">Figure 3</a>).</p>
<p>The SemNet approach is to show a <em>central</em> node in the middle
of a screen, and show around it the nodes directly connected
to it. When the user double-clicks on one of the connected nodes,
it is made the central node. We call this approach <em>navigational</em>.</p>

<h1><a name="fentwine">Fentwine</a></h1>
<p>In this section we introduce Fentwine, our prototype of a navigational 
RDF browser and editor. Fentwine is part of the <a class="reference" href="http://fenfire.org/">Fenfire</a> project,
which develops an RDF-based desktop environment 
(<a class="reference" href="#fallenstein-and-lukka-2004">Fallenstein and Lukka 2004</a>).</p>
<p>Fentwine shows the nodes connected directly to the central node
on an ellipse around the central node. Nodes more than one step
away from the central node are also shown, up to a maximum
number of steps. Nodes further away from the center fade
into the background.</p>
<p>The property of each connection is shown
between the two connected nodes. Each property is shown
in a different color, computed deterministically from the
property's URI. This allows the user to recognize
the type of a connection without reading the property name.</p>
<p>Fentwine hides nodes' and property's URIs if a natural language
label is available. For example, this can be a person's name. 
A pre-defined set of properties for finding the label
of a node is provided (containing e.g. <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">rdf:label</span></tt> 
and <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">foaf:name</span></tt>). The user can extend this set.</p>
<p>We show the user a list of the properties in the current
RDF graph, which allows them to show or hide each property separately.
Properties can be grouped in categories which can be
switched on and off as a whole. For example, when browsing
a FOAF network, the user can hide all properties except <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">foaf:knows</span></tt>.
This reduces clutter by hiding relationships irrelevant to the
task at hand (for example, <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">foaf:workplaceHomepage</span></tt>). 
This feature derives from Nelson's ZigZag (<a class="reference" href="#nelson-2004">Nelson 2004</a>).</p>
<p>A screenshot is shown in Figure 4. Figure 5 shows
how Fentwine uses animation to make moving from one central node
to another smooth.</p>

<p>Fentwine works reasonably well for graphs created with it, as well as
for many RDF files on the Web, as long as the properties to use to find
natural-language labels are specified. However, there are many
RDF structures that it does not represent well, yet.</p>
<p>An example is shown in Figure 6. The structure shown specifies 
that ovo-vegetarian food is a subclass of the intersection of a class
equivalent to food with the complement of the union of a subclass of meat, 
including fish, with a subclass of dairy. (We didn't write the ontology.)</p>

One is tempted to make a comment 
about mazes of twisty little passages, all alike.
(<a class="reference" href="fig6a.png">Larger version</a>)</p>
</div>
<p>The problem seems to be that there are many interconnected
anonymous nodes that don't have labels.
We hope that this problem can be solved
by providing special ways to render these structures, which map
more directly to the user's mental model.</p>
<p>We already use this approach to show RDF collections. In Figure 6,
the values of e.g. <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">owl:unionOf</span></tt> are collections. Instead of 
showing the internal RDF structure, we show different <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">unionOf</span></tt>
&quot;connections&quot; between the union and each member of the collection.
This appears to work well.
(However, we have not yet decided how collection properties should be
visually distinguished from ordinary properties; currently,
we show connective lines between the elements of the collection.)</p>

<div class="section" id="conclusions">
<h1><a name="conclusions">Conclusions</a></h1>
<p>We have proposed to adapt SemNet's navigational approach to
graph browsing to RDF, and reported on our work-in-progress implementation.
Our software works reasonably well for some kinds of RDF, but
structures that make use of many connected anonymous nodes without
properties that could be used as labels (such as OWL intersections)
are not yet shown well.</p>
