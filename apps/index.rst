Currently, Fenfire is best applicable to `browsing and editing`_ RDF files.
You can use the same features to view some Semantic Web data and RSS
feeds of weblogs, for instance. Keeping notes or such is also
possible, but requires more technical understanding than the goal
would be.

Reading PDF files is almost usable as well, and keeping an archive of
linked articles and notes about them is not far away either.

If you run `Gnowsis`_, Fenfire can integrate to its
services. This means that Fenfire is able to both ask for data about items
from Gnowsis, and tell Gnowsis to open items such as email messages
and web pages.
